##Current
Freelance editor, writer, academic writing coach

##Education
Ph.D. in English from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, May 2015

##Research Interests 
Writing pedagogy, digital humanities, fashion, nineteenth-century American literature 

##Summary
My strong track record working with writers includes three years of experience as a freelance editor, editing academic writing for publication, as well as 10 years of experience teaching academic writing to 500+ diverse learners (including developing writers and English-language learners). I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, with expertise in both formal and informal presentations; my experience includes 10 years of classroom teaching and multiple professional conference presentations. I am an adaptable, quick, and accurate independent learner with strong project-management and time-management skills: I researched, wrote, revised, edited, and formatted a 300+ page dissertation research project, which was accepted without revisions, while teaching every semester (a total of 32 courses in 10 years). I work well both collaboratively and independently, and thrive in deadline-driven, fast-paced environments. Finally, I have a track record of success in both personnel management and client satisfaction. 

##Academic Editing
Edited more than 40 journal articles, conference papers, and grant applications for researchers in computer science, biology, math education, and other STEM fields, specializing in work by non-native speakers. Services provided include everything from developmental editing, with a focus on clarity of argument and global organization, to production of camera-ready copy for publication.

Edited both internal and federal grant applications, including NSF and NIH grants.
